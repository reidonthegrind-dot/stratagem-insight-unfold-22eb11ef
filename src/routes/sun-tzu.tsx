        Two and a half millennia after it was written, <em>The Art of War</em> reads less like a relic and more
        like a market-entry playbook. Sun Tzu's argument is simple: the smartest general wins before the fight begins.

      <Section title="1. Know the terrain — know the market.">
        <p>
          Sun Tzu insists that victory belongs to the commander who reads the ground before stepping on it.
          Translated into business, the{" "}
          <Term definition="In Sun Tzu, the physical ground of battle. In business, the full landscape a company operates in: customers, regulators, competitors, and cultural mood.">
            "terrain"
          </Term>{" "}
          is the market itself: the customers, the regulators, the
          competitors, the cultural mood. A founder launching a product without studying the terrain is, by
          Sun Tzu's standard, already defeated <Cite>(Tzu, Griffith trans., ch. X)</Cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a marketing standpoint this becomes literal: you must know who you are speaking to (the terrain)
          and who else is speaking to them (the opponent). A strong{" "}

            strategist
          </Term>{" "}
          with a smaller budget can still
          win because they have mapped the ground their rival is fumbling across blindly.

      <Section title="2. Win without fighting.">
        <p>
          The most quoted line of <em>The Art of War</em> — "the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without
          fighting" — is also the one most aggressively applied in modern business. Mark McNeilly translates it as
          the principle of capturing markets through innovation rather than through{" "}
          <Term definition="A competitive race in which rivals repeatedly cut prices to undercut each other, often shrinking everyone's profit until only the cheapest survives.">
            price wars
          </Term>
          <Cite>(McNeilly 23–46)</Cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple's iPhone launch is McNeilly's textbook case. Apple did not undercut Nokia or BlackBerry on price; it
          made the conversation about price irrelevant by redefining what a phone could be. That is winning without
          fighting: rendering the opponent's strategy useless rather than defeating it head-on.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="3. Attack weakness, not strength.">
        <p>
          Sun Tzu warns against{" "}
          <Term definition="A direct, head-on attack against the strongest, most defended part of an opponent — usually costly and rarely decisive.">
            frontal assault
          </Term>{" "}
          on a fortified position. McNeilly maps this directly onto
          competitive strategy — exploit a competitor's strategic gaps instead of meeting their strengths
          <Cite>(McNeilly 71–94)</Cite>. Microsoft's early dominance, he argues, came not from out-engineering IBM
          but from occupying the operating-system seat that IBM had left lightly defended.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="4. Speed and psychological dominance.">
        <p>
          Sun Tzu prizes speed: a campaign drawn out too long drains the treasury and the morale of the troops
          <Cite>(Tzu, Griffith trans., ch. II)</Cite>. In the modern startup vocabulary this is "shipping fast,"{" "}
          <Term definition="The competitive edge a company gains by being the first to enter a new market — capturing customers, brand recognition, and key partnerships before rivals arrive.">
            "first-mover advantage,"

          and{" "}

            "blitzscaling."
          </Term>{" "}
          The psychological half is just as old: a competitor who
          believes they have already lost will stop investing in the fight.
