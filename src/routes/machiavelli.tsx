      <Section title="1. The first job: keep the state alive.">
        <p>
          Machiavelli's prince has one main job: make sure his state survives.
          The modern version is easy to see.
          A CEO's first job, in the eyes of the board, is to keep the company strong and{" "}

          , and shutdowns are not seen as wrong inside this view. They are moves that keep the company
          standing.

      <Section title="2. The lion and the fox.">
        <p>
          Machiavelli writes that a leader has to be both a{" "}

          (to spot traps)
          <Cite>(Machiavelli, Marriott trans., ch. XVIII)</Cite>. Today's CEO does both jobs every week.
          The lion shows up in the big speech to staff and in the press. The fox shows up in private
          meetings, in legal moves, and in the timing of an{" "}

      <Section title="3. Feared or loved?">
        <p>
          Machiavelli's most famous question is whether a leader should be feared or loved. His real
          answer is that having both is best. But if a leader has to pick one, fear is safer. Love is
          something other people give you, so they can also take it back. Fear is something you control
          yourself. Loyalty based on warm feelings can vanish the moment things get hard. Loyalty based
          on real consequences sticks around.
        </p>
        <p>
          The modern version is easy to spot. Companies that try to run only on the "we're a family"
          feeling tend to fall apart the second the market turns. Companies that mix real loyalty with
          real consequences, like{" "}
          <Term definition="A schedule that gives employees ownership of company stock gradually over time, so they only fully earn it if they stay long enough.">
            equity vesting

          ,{" "}
          <Term definition="A clause in an employment contract that bars a worker from joining a competitor for a set period after leaving.">
            non-competes
          </Term>
          , and performance reviews, last longer than the vibe.

      <Section title="4. Acting the part.">
        <p>
          Machiavelli is blunt. A prince has to <em>look</em> kind, honest, caring, and good, even when
          his actual choices are the opposite <Cite>(Machiavelli, Marriott trans., ch. XVIII)</Cite>.
          Modern CEOs do the same thing. Public reports about openness, mission statements about
          "doing the right thing," and carefully planned town halls are the same old Renaissance idea
          dressed up in HR language. The most{" "}

          thing a CEO can do today is look like they would never do anything Machiavellian.
