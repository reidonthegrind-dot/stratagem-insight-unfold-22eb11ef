        <p>
          Machiavelli's prince serves one master: the continued existence of his state
          <Cite>(Machiavelli, Marriott trans., ch. III)</Cite>. The modern translation is unmistakable —
          a CEO's first duty, in the eyes of the board, is the continued{" "}

          , and shutdowns are not failures of ethics inside this framework; they are stabilizing
          maneuvers.

      <Section title="2. The lion and the fox.">
        <p>
          A leader, Machiavelli writes, must be both a lion (to frighten wolves) and a fox (to recognize traps)
          <Cite>(Machiavelli, Marriott trans., ch. XVIII)</Cite>. Today's executive embodies this hybrid daily:
          the lion appears in the all-hands speech and the press cycle; the fox shows up in the closed-door
          negotiation, the legal strategy, the timing of an acquisition.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="3. Feared or loved?">
        <p>
          Machiavelli's most famous question is whether it is better to be feared or loved. His answer, often
          flattened, is that <em>both</em> is ideal — but if forced to choose, fear is more reliable, because
          love is granted by others while fear is held by you. Loyalty built on affection evaporates the moment
          conditions change; loyalty built on consequence does not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern parallel: companies that rely solely on cultural affection ("we're a family") collapse the
          instant the market turns. Companies that combine genuine loyalty with structural consequence —
          equity vesting, non-competes, performance review — outlast the mood.
        </p>

      <Section title="4. The performance of virtue.">
        <p>
          Machiavelli is blunt: a prince must <em>appear</em> merciful, faithful, humane, religious, and upright,
          even when policy requires the opposite <Cite>(Machiavelli, Marriott trans., ch. XVIII)</Cite>. The
          modern CEO has inherited this exactly. Public-facing transparency reports, mission statements about
          "doing the right thing," carefully staged town halls — these are the Renaissance virtues in HR clothing.
          The most Machiavellian move available to a 21st-century executive is to look the least Machiavellian.
